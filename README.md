*Notes*

March 16... I'm realizing after initial setup and ~30 min of research that this isn't going to be a very straightforward project. I've already identified two sizeable hurdles; 1. Importing my API key securely into script.js, 2. Writing JS code to "read" an entire webpage, excluding images, or a function to copy all of the text on screen to feed into the API. This is going to require some more research and asking some SWEs more skilled than me.
